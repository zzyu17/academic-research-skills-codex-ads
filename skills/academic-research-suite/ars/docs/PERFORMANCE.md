# ARS Performance Notes

> **Recommended model: Claude Opus 4.7** with **Max plan** (or equivalent configuration). Opus 4.7 uses adaptive thinking; you no longer set a fixed thinking budget.
>
> The full academic pipeline (10 stages) consumes a **large amount of tokens** — a single end-to-end run can exceed 200K input + 100K output tokens depending on paper length and revision rounds. Budget accordingly.
>
> Individual skills (e.g., `deep-research` alone, or `academic-paper-reviewer` alone) consume significantly less.

## Estimated token usage by mode

| Skill / Mode | Input Tokens | Output Tokens | Estimated Cost (Opus 4.7) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `deep-research` socratic | ~30K | ~15K | ~$0.60 |
| `deep-research` full | ~60K | ~30K | ~$1.20 |
| `deep-research` systematic-review | ~100K | ~50K | ~$2.00 |
| `academic-paper` plan | ~40K | ~20K | ~$0.80 |
| `academic-paper` full | ~80K | ~50K | ~$1.80 |
| `academic-paper-reviewer` full | ~50K | ~30K | ~$1.10 |
| `academic-paper-reviewer` quick | ~15K | ~8K | ~$0.30 |
| **Full pipeline (10 stages)** | **~200K+** | **~100K+** | **~$4-6** |
| + Cross-model verification | +~10K (external) | +~5K (external) | +~$0.60-1.10 |

*Estimates based on a ~15,000-word paper with ~60 references. Actual usage varies with paper length, revision rounds, and dialogue depth. Costs at Anthropic API pricing as of April 2026.*

## Recommended Claude Code settings

| Setting | What it does | How to enable | Docs |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Agent Team** (optional) | Enables `TeamCreate` / `SendMessage` tools for manual multi-agent coordination. **ARS's internal parallelization does not require this flag** — skills spawn subagents via the built-in `Agent` tool directly. Only useful if you want to manually orchestrate persistent team workflows across sessions. | Set `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` (research preview) | Experimental feature — no stable docs yet |
| **Skip Permissions** | Bypasses per-tool confirmation prompts, enabling uninterrupted autonomous execution across all pipeline stages | Launch with `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` | [Permissions](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/cli-reference) · [Advanced Usage](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/advanced) |

> **⚠️ Skip Permissions**: This flag disables all tool-use confirmation dialogs. Use at your own discretion — it is convenient for trusted, long-running pipelines but removes the safety net of manual approval. Only enable this in environments where you are comfortable with Claude executing file reads, writes, and shell commands without asking first.

## Long-running session management

The full academic pipeline is designed for human-in-the-loop execution, with mandatory user confirmation at every stage. In practice, a full run often spans hours to days — longer than Anthropic's prompt cache TTL (5 minutes). Two consequences:

1. **Cache misses between checkpoints are normal.** When a stage checkpoint pauses longer than 5 minutes, the next stage reads its context uncached. This is an unavoidable cost of human-paced pipelines.
2. **Cross-session resume relies on Material Passport.** ARS does not maintain its own orchestrator state between sessions. To resume in a new session, paste your Material Passport YAML back; the orchestrator reads `compliance_history[]` and stage completion markers to locate your breakpoint.

### v3.4.0 compliance agent cost

Adding the mode-aware `compliance_agent` to Stage 2.5 and Stage 4.5 increases full-pipeline SR tokens by approximately:

| Skill / Mode | Input Tokens | Output Tokens | Estimated Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| `deep-research systematic-review` (2.5 only) | +~5–8K | +~3–5K | +~$0.15 |
| Full pipeline SR (2.5 + 4.5) | +~10–15K | +~5–8K | +~$0.30 |
| `academic-paper full` (pre-finalize) | +~3–5K | +~2–3K | +~$0.08 |

These are on top of the existing per-skill costs in the table above (same 15,000-word / 60-reference basis; see footnote on line 23). Cross-model verification costs (if enabled) are unchanged.

### v3.6.3 Passport reset boundary (opt-in)

When `ARS_PASSPORT_RESET=1` is set, every FULL checkpoint becomes a context-reset boundary. The intended workflow is:

1. Run a stage to FULL checkpoint in session A.
2. Copy the `[PASSPORT-RESET: hash=<hash>, stage=<completed>, next=<next>]` tag from the checkpoint notification.
3. Start a fresh Claude Code session (session B) and paste `resume_from_passport=<hash>`. Optional overrides: `resume_from_passport=<hash> stage=<n> mode=<m>`.
4. Session B loads only the passport ledger; no replay of session A's turns. The orchestrator locates the matching `kind: boundary` entry, appends a `kind: resume` entry to consume it, and continues. The resumed stage is determined by: a `stage=` CLI override if supplied, else the matched option's `next_stage` when the boundary carries a `pending_decision` (the orchestrator re-prompts the user first), else the recorded `next` field. `next` MAY be `null` when all decision branches terminate.

**When reset beats continuation:**

- Long pipelines where session A has accumulated >100K input tokens of context that the next stage does not actually need.
- `systematic-review` mode runs where stage independence is cleanly defined by the Material Passport.
- Any case where you hit the 5-minute prompt-cache TTL mid-pipeline; a reset lets the next stage start fresh instead of paying a cache miss on a bloated context.

**When continuation still wins:**

- Short pipelines (< 30K input tokens end-to-end).
- Stages with implicit in-session state that the passport does not capture (e.g., a Socratic dialogue branch the user wants to keep warm).
- When the flag is OFF, continuation is the unchanged pre-v3.6.3 default.

**Passport file location convention:**

By default, the orchestrator looks for the passport file in `./passports/<slug>/` or matching `./material_passport*.yaml` relative to the current working directory. Resolving the hash to a passport file on disk is the integrator's responsibility; the orchestrator loads whichever passport the enclosing tool provides. See §"Passport file location convention" above for the `./passports/<slug>/` default.

The resume command only defines the hash and optional stage/mode overrides:

```
resume_from_passport=<hash> [stage=<n>] [mode=<m>]
```

There is no path syntax on the resume command itself. Custom passport locations are configured in the project's `CLAUDE.md` or handled by the integrator's tooling before the orchestrator is invoked.

**Empirical token savings:** measurement pending a real `systematic-review` run with instrumentation. This section will be updated with observed token deltas once available; until then, no numeric claim is made. See [`../academic-pipeline/references/passport_as_reset_boundary.md`](../academic-pipeline/references/passport_as_reset_boundary.md) for the full protocol.

## Literature corpus ingestion (v3.6.4+)

The Material Passport `literature_corpus[]` field is populated by user-written adapters, not ARS itself. Three reference adapters ship with v3.6.4: `scripts/adapters/folder_scan.py`, `scripts/adapters/zotero.py`, `scripts/adapters/obsidian.py`. See [`scripts/adapters/README.md`](../scripts/adapters/README.md) for how to run them and how to write your own.

### Performance posture

- Adapters run out-of-band (before an ARS session, not during). Their runtime is the user's problem, not ARS's.
- Adapters must be deterministic: re-running on identical input produces byte-identical output modulo timestamps.
- `literature_corpus[]` entries are sorted by `citation_key`; rejections are sorted by `source`.
- Adapter output size grows linearly with corpus size. A 500-entry Zotero library typically produces a passport of ~300 KB YAML. ARS consumers should lazy-load when the corpus is large.

### What v3.6.4 does NOT do

- Does not ingest PDFs, extract text, or run OCR.
- Does not call the Zotero Web API, Notion API, or any live service.
- Does not fetch paywalled content or use user credentials to access institutional libraries.

These boundaries are deliberate and reflect the ARS data-layer decision: ARS is a writing/review-layer framework; corpus integration stays in user-owned code. Users who want API-based live-sync adapters are expected to write them themselves, using the three reference adapters as starting points.

### Consumer-side integration

As of v3.6.4, no ARS agent reads `literature_corpus[]`. The field is a defined input port only. Consumer-side integration (agents that actually USE the corpus for research planning, citation generation, etc.) is deferred to v3.6.5+.
